# Module 1

**Module 1: Introduction to Operating Systems**

---

### **1. Introduction**
- **What is an Operating System (OS)?**
  - A program acting as an intermediary between a user and computer hardware.
  - Goals:
    - Execute user programs and simplify problem-solving.
    - Enhance convenience in using the computer system.
    - Ensure efficient hardware utilization.

### **3. System Boot**
- **Booting:** The process of starting a computer by loading the kernel.
- **Bootstrap Program:**
  - Stored in ROM or EEPROM (firmware).
  - Locates and loads the kernel into memory, starting its execution.
  - Initializes system aspects.

### **4. OS Services**
Operating systems provide functionalities for both users and the system itself:
- **User-Focused Services:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** Can be CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface).
  - **Program Execution:** OS loads, executes, and manages program termination.
  - **I/O Operations:** Manages file or device-related input/output operations.
  - **File-System Manipulation:** Includes reading, writing, creating, deleting files, and managing permissions.
  - **Communications:** Enables process communication on the same/different systems (via shared memory or message passing).
  - **Error Detection:** Monitors errors in hardware, I/O devices, and user programs to ensure consistent computing.

- **System-Focused Services:**
  - **Resource Allocation:** Allocates resources like CPU cycles, memory, and I/O devices to concurrent users/jobs.
  - **Accounting:** Tracks resource usage.
  - **Protection and Security:**
    - Controls access to resources.
    - Implements user authentication and defends against unauthorized access or attacks.

### **5. Views of OS Services**
The slides provide a visual representation of how services are structured, likely depicting user interaction and system functions.

### **6. OS Structuring Methods**
Different structures include:
- **Monolithic OS:** All functionalities in one layer (e.g., MS-DOS).

- **Layered OS:** Organized into layers, where each layer depends only on lower layers.

- **Microkernel OS:**
  - Minimal kernel, most functionalities in user space.
  - Communication via message passing.
  - Benefits: Easier to extend, port, and secure.
  - Drawback: Performance overhead.

  - 
- **Kernel Modular OS:** Combines layered and microkernel advantages using dynamically loadable modules (e.g., Linux, Solaris).

### **7. OS Design Issues**
Major design considerations include:
- Transparency, flexibility, reliability, performance, scalability, replication, synchronization, and security.

---

### **8. Abstraction in OS**
- Abstracts hardware complexity and provides a common API for application development.
- Simplifies device management, maintenance, and portability.
- Includes a **Command Interpreter (Shell)** for executing commands.

---

### **9. Program Execution Process**
- **Program (secondary memory) â†’ Process (main memory).**
- OS creates a process with three segments:
  - **Code Segment (CS):** Instructions to execute.
  - **Data Segment (DS):** Required data.
  - **Stack Segment (SS):** For procedure calls.
- **Security with Segmentation:** Ensures privilege levels for memory access.

---

### **10. Protection and Security**
- **Protection:** Mechanisms for resource access control.
- **Security:** Defense against attacks like viruses, identity theft, etc.
- Uses user IDs and group IDs to control access.

---

### **11. Computing Environments**
- **Traditional Standalone Systems:** General-purpose machines, now often interconnected.
- **Distributed Systems:** Multiple networked systems (LAN, WAN, MAN) enabling communication.
- **Client-Server Model:** Servers provide services to client systems (e.g., file servers, compute servers).
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems:** Nodes act as both clients and servers (e.g., Skype, Napster).
- **Mobile Computing:** Smartphones and tablets with extra OS features like GPS.
- **Virtualization:** Runs OSes within others (e.g., VMware).
- **Cloud Computing:** Offers computing/storage as a service (e.g., SaaS, PaaS, IaaS).
- **Real-Time Embedded Systems:** Special-purpose systems with fixed time constraints.
- **Open Source OS:** Freely available source code (e.g., Linux, BSD UNIX).
