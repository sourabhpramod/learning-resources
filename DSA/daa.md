# Module 6 and 7

## Explanations:

Okay, here's a breakdown of the topics covered in the two PowerPoint presentations:

**Presentation 1: Computational Geometry**

This presentation introduces fundamental concepts and algorithms in computational geometry, focusing on line segment problems. Here's a summary of the key topics:

* **Line-segment Questions**:  The presentation starts by posing key questions related to line segments, such as determining if they intersect, checking for left or right turns, and determining clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. [cite: 1, 61, 62, 63, 64] It emphasizes efficient methods to solve these problems. [cite: 64]
   
* **Cross Products**:  A core concept used to solve line-segment problems. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   
    * The cross product of two vectors is introduced, and its geometric interpretation as the signed area of a parallelogram is explained. [cite: 2]
    * The sign of the cross product determines the orientation of one vector relative to another (clockwise or counterclockwise). [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * Cross products are used to determine turns (left or right) at a point where two line segments meet. [cite: 5, 6, 7]
   
* **Determining Line Segment Intersection**:  The presentation details how to determine whether two line segments intersect. [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
   
    * The primary condition for intersection involves checking if each segment "straddles" the line containing the other segment. [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
    * Special cases, such as when an endpoint lies on the other segment, are also considered. [cite: 10, 11, 52, 53]
   
* **Sweep Line Algorithm**:  This technique is introduced as a method for efficiently finding intersections among a set of line segments. [cite: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]
   
    * The algorithm uses an imaginary vertical line that sweeps across the set of segments. [cite: 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33]
    * A data structure (sweep-line status) maintains the vertical ordering of the segments intersected by the sweep line. [cite: 23, 30, 31, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
    * Event points (segment endpoints) trigger updates to the sweep-line status. [cite: 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 48, 49, 50, 51]
   
* **Algorithm Pseudocode**:  The presentation includes pseudocode for the segment intersection algorithm. [cite: 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 59]
   
* **Convex Combinations**:  The concept of convex combinations is explained in the context of line segments. [cite: 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]
   
    * A convex combination represents a point on a line segment as a weighted average of its endpoints. [cite: 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]

**Presentation 2: Network Flow**

    * Key concepts: augmenting paths, residual networks, and cuts. [cite: 72, 73, 74, 77, 78]
    * Illustrates augmenting paths and residual networks with examples. [cite: 73, 74, 77, 78]
    * Outlines the basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. [cite: 77, 78]
   
* **Analysis of Ford-Fulkerson**:  Discusses the running time and limitations of the algorithm. [cite: 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86]
   
    * The running time depends on the maximum flow value. [cite: 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86]
    * The choice of augmenting paths affects efficiency. [cite: 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86]
    * The algorithm's behavior with rational and irrational edge capacities is considered. [cite: 83, 84, 85, 86]

## Psuedocodes

**Presentation 1: Computational Geometry**

**1. Cross Product**

   * **Explanation**: The cross product is a fundamental operation for determining the relative orientation of two vectors in a 2D plane. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Given two vectors p1 = (x1, y1) and p2 = (x2, y2), their cross product is a scalar value calculated as:

     ```
     p1 x p2 = x1 * y2 - x2 * y1
     ```

   * **Pseudocode**:

     ```
     function CROSS_PRODUCT(p1, p2)
         x1 = p1.x
         y1 = p1.y
         x2 = p2.x
         y2 = p2.y
         return (x1 * y2 - x2 * y1)
     ```

   * **Interpretation**:
   
     * If `p1 x p2` is positive, p1 is clockwise from p2. [cite: 2, 3]
     * If `p1 x p2` is negative, p1 is counterclockwise from p2. [cite: 2, 3]
     * If `p1 x p2` is zero, p1 and p2 are collinear. [cite: 3, 4]

**2. Determining Whether Consecutive Segments Turn Left or Right**

   * **Explanation**: This uses the cross product to determine the turn direction at a point where two line segments meet. [cite: 5, 6, 7] Given consecutive segments p0p1 and p1p2, we calculate the cross product of the vectors (p1 - p0) and (p2 - p0).
   
   * **Pseudocode**:

     ```
     function TURN_DIRECTION(p0, p1, p2)
         vector1 = (p1.x - p0.x, p1.y - p0.y)
         vector2 = (p2.x - p0.x, p2.y - p0.y)
         cross_product_val = CROSS_PRODUCT(vector1, vector2)
         if cross_product_val > 0
             return "Right Turn"
         else if cross_product_val < 0
             return "Left Turn"
         else
             return "Collinear"
     ```

**3. Determining Whether Two Line Segments Intersect**

   * **Explanation**: To check if segments p1p2 and p3p4 intersect, we need to check two conditions:
   
     * Each segment straddles the line containing the other. [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11]
     * An endpoint of one segment lies on the other segment (boundary case). [cite: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
   
   * **Pseudocode**:

     ```
     function ON_SEGMENT(p, q, r)
         if q.x <= max(p.x, r.x) and q.x >= min(p.x, r.x) and
            q.y <= max(p.y, r.y) and q.y >= min(p.y, r.y)
             return true
         else
             return false
     
     function DIRECTION(pi, pj, pk)
         return CROSS_PRODUCT((pk.x - pi.x, pk.y - pi.y), (pj.x - pi.x, pj.y - pi.y))
     
     function SEGMENTS_INTERSECT(p1, p2, p3, p4)
         d1 = DIRECTION(p3, p4, p1)
         d2 = DIRECTION(p3, p4, p2)
         d3 = DIRECTION(p1, p2, p3)
         d4 = DIRECTION(p1, p2, p4)
     
         if ((d1 > 0 and d2 < 0) or (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0)) and
            ((d3 > 0 and d4 < 0) or (d3 < 0 and d4 > 0))
             return true
         else if d1 == 0 and ON_SEGMENT(p3, p1, p4)
             return true
         else if d2 == 0 and ON_SEGMENT(p3, p2, p4)
             return true
         else if d3 == 0 and ON_SEGMENT(p1, p3, p2)
             return true
         else if d4 == 0 and ON_SEGMENT(p1, p4, p2)
             return true
         else
             return false
     ```

**4. Sweep Line Algorithm for Finding Intersections**

   * **Explanation**: This algorithm efficiently finds all intersections among a set of line segments. [cite: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
   
     * A vertical "sweep line" moves from left to right across the segments.
     * The x-coordinates of segment endpoints are "event points."
     * A data structure (usually a balanced binary search tree like a red-black tree) maintains the order of segments intersecting the sweep line.
     * Intersections are detected when the order of segments changes.
   
   * **Pseudocode**:

     ```
     function FIND_INTERSECTIONS(segments)
         event_points = SORT_BY_X_COORDINATE(endpoints(segments))  // Sort endpoints
         T = EMPTY_BINARY_SEARCH_TREE  // Sweep line status
     
         for each point p in event_points
             if p is the left endpoint of segment s
                 INSERT(T, s)
                 above_s = ABOVE(T, s)
                 below_s = BELOW(T, s)
                 if above_s != null and SEGMENTS_INTERSECT(s, above_s)
                     return true
                 if below_s != null and SEGMENTS_INTERSECT(s, below_s)
                     return true
             else if p is the right endpoint of segment s
                 above_s = ABOVE(T, s)
                 below_s = BELOW(T, s)
                 if above_s != null and below_s != null and SEGMENTS_INTERSECT(above_s, below_s)
                     return true
                 DELETE(T, s)
         return false
     ```

**Presentation 2: Network Flow**

**1. Ford-Fulkerson Method**

   * **Explanation**: This is a classic method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. [cite: 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87]
   
     * It iteratively finds augmenting paths (paths from source to sink with available capacity) and pushes flow along these paths.
     * The residual network is updated after each flow augmentation to reflect the remaining capacity.
   
   * **Pseudocode**:

     ```
     function FORD_FULKERSON(graph, source, sink)
         flow = 0  // Initialize flow to 0
         while there exists an augmenting path p in the residual network Gf
             path_flow = MIN_CAPACITY(p)  // Find minimum capacity along path p
             flow = flow + path_flow
             for each edge (u, v) in p
                 if (u, v) is in graph
                     f(u, v) = f(u, v) + path_flow
                     f(v, u) = f(v, u) - path_flow  // Update reverse flow
                 else 
                     f(v, u) = f(v, u) - path_flow
         return flow
     
     function FIND_AUGMENTING_PATH(graph, source, sink)
         //  Use BFS or DFS to find a path from source to sink in residual network
         //  Return the path or null if no path exists
     
     function MIN_CAPACITY(path)
         //  Find the minimum residual capacity along the path
     ```

**2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

   * **Explanation**: BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph layer by layer. [cite: 65, 87, 88, 89, 90] It's often used to find the shortest path from a source node to other nodes.
   
   * **Pseudocode**:

     ```
     function BFS(graph, source)
         for each vertex u in graph.vertices
             u.color = "white"  // undiscovered
             u.distance = infinity
             u.predecessor = null
         source.color = "gray"  // discovered
         source.distance = 0
         source.predecessor = null
         Q = new Queue()
         Q.enqueue(source)
     
         while Q is not empty
             u = Q.dequeue()
             for each neighbor v of u
                 if v.color == "white"
                     v.color = "gray"
                     v.distance = u.distance + 1
                     v.predecessor = u
                     Q.enqueue(v)
             u.color = "black"  // finished
     ```

These pseudocode examples provide a more detailed, step-by-step representation of the algorithms discussed in the presentations, making it easier to understand and implement them.
