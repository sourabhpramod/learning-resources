The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves specific functions and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. Here’s a breakdown of the seven layers and their functions:

### 1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
   - **Function**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission of raw data (bits) over a physical medium, such as cables, radio frequencies, or fiber optics. It defines the hardware elements, such as cables, switches, voltage levels, and physical data rates.
   - **Example**: Ethernet cables, hubs, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi.

### 2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
   - **Function**: This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction. It also manages access to the physical medium (i.e., how devices share the communication channel). It divides data into frames for easier transmission.
   - **Sub-Layers**:
     - **MAC (Media Access Control)**: Controls access to the physical medium and handles addressing.
     - **LLC (Logical Link Control)**: Manages communication between devices and provides error checking.
   - **Example**: Ethernet, MAC addresses, switches.

### 3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
   - **Function**: The network layer is responsible for data routing, switching, and addressing so that data can travel across different networks. It decides the best physical path for the data to take.
   - **Example**: IP (Internet Protocol), routers.

### 4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
   - **Function**: This layer ensures reliable data transfer between host systems, providing error recovery and flow control. It divides data into segments, ensures they are sent in sequence, and reassembles them at the destination.
   - **Protocols**:
     - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Provides reliable data transmission with acknowledgment.
     - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides faster, connectionless, but less reliable data transmission.
   - **Example**: TCP, UDP, port numbers.

### 5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
   - **Function**: The session layer manages and controls the connection between two systems, ensuring that sessions are established, maintained, and terminated in an orderly way. It also handles dialogue control, synchronization, and session recovery.
   - **Example**: Network sessions, authentication, session establishment.

### 6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
   - **Function**: The presentation layer translates data between the application layer and the rest of the OSI model. It handles data encryption, compression, and format conversion, ensuring that data from the application layer is readable by the receiving system.
   - **Example**: Data encryption (TLS), data compression, character encoding (ASCII, JPEG, MP4).

### 7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
   - **Function**: This is the layer where user interaction happens. It provides services directly to end users and applications, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. It supports network services like file access, file sharing, and database management.
   - **Example**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

In summary, the OSI model ensures that communication between systems is standardized, with each layer serving specific roles to ensure smooth data transmission and reception.


Here’s a detailed breakdown of each concept:

# Module 4

---

### **1. IPv4 Address Space**
- **Definition**: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) provides a 32-bit address space, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **Structure**: 
  - An IPv4 address is represented in **dotted decimal notation** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - Each address has four octets (8 bits each), separated by dots.
  - Example: `192.168.1.1` in binary is `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`.

- **Address Range**:
  - Total possible addresses = \( 2^{32} = 4,294,967,296 \).
  - Some addresses are reserved (e.g., private addresses like `192.168.0.0/16` and multicast addresses).

---

### **2. Notations**
- **Dotted Decimal**: IPv4 addresses are written in base 10 (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **Binary**: Represents each octet as 8 bits (e.g., `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`).
- **CIDR Notation**: Specifies the network prefix length (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24` means the first 24 bits are the network portion).

---

### **3. Classful Addressing**
- **Concept**: An early method to divide IPv4 addresses into five predefined classes based on the first few bits.
- **Classes**:
  - **Class A**: 
    - First bit: `0`
    - Range: `0.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`
    - Large networks; 8 bits for the network, 24 bits for hosts.
  - **Class B**:
    - First two bits: `10`
    - Range: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`
    - Medium networks; 16 bits for the network, 16 bits for hosts.
  - **Class C**:
    - First three bits: `110`
    - Range: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`
    - Small networks; 24 bits for the network, 8 bits for hosts.
  - **Class D**:
    - First four bits: `1110`
    - Range: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
    - Used for multicast.
  - **Class E**:
    - First four bits: `1111`
    - Range: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`
    - Reserved for experimental purposes.

---

### **4. Classless Addressing (CIDR)**
- **Concept**: Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) replaced classful addressing to use IP addresses more efficiently.
- **Key Features**:
  - Networks are not restricted by class boundaries.
  - Network and host portions are defined by a subnet mask or prefix length (e.g., `/24`).
  - Example: `192.168.1.0/24` means 24 bits are for the network, and 8 bits are for hosts.
  - Helps mitigate IPv4 address exhaustion.

---

### **5. Network Address Translation (NAT)**
- **Definition**: NAT maps private IP addresses within a network to a single public IP address for accessing the internet.
- **Purpose**:
  - Conserves IPv4 address space.
  - Hides internal network structure for security.
- **Types**:
  - **Static NAT**: Maps one private IP to one public IP.
  - **Dynamic NAT**: Maps a pool of private IPs to a pool of public IPs.
  - **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using different ports.

---

### **6. IPv6 Address Structure**
- **Definition**: IPv6 is the successor to IPv4, offering a 128-bit address space.
- **Format**: Written in hexadecimal, divided into eight 16-bit blocks separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
- **Features**:
  - Supports \( 2^{128} \) addresses (approximately \( 3.4 \times 10^{38} \)).
  - Allows **zero compression**: Consecutive zeros can be replaced by `::` (e.g., `2001:db8::1`).
  - **Unicast, Multicast, and Anycast** addresses:
    - **Unicast**: For single device communication.
    - **Multicast**: For one-to-many communication.
    - **Anycast**: For one-to-nearest communication.

---

### **7. IPv4 Header Format**
- **Structure**:
  - **Version**: 4 bits (always `4` for IPv4).
  - **Header Length**: 4 bits.
  - **Type of Service (ToS)**: 8 bits.
  - **Total Length**: 16 bits.
  - **Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset**: For packet fragmentation and reassembly.
  - **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: 8 bits, limits the lifetime of a packet.
  - **Protocol**: 8 bits, identifies the protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).
  - **Header Checksum**: 16 bits, verifies integrity.
  - **Source and Destination Address**: 32 bits each.

---

### **8. IPv6 Header Format**
- **Structure**:
  - **Version**: 4 bits (always `6` for IPv6).
  - **Traffic Class**: 8 bits, similar to ToS in IPv4.
  - **Flow Label**: 20 bits, for identifying traffic flows.
  - **Payload Length**: 16 bits, length of data following the header.
  - **Next Header**: 8 bits, identifies the protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).
  - **Hop Limit**: 8 bits, similar to TTL in IPv4.
  - **Source and Destination Address**: 128 bits each.
