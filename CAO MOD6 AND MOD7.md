# CAO MOD 6 AND 7 COMPLETE IN DETAIL:


Here's the full detailed breakdown of **everything** in your uploaded presentations. I've ensured no detail is missed, simplifying where needed while retaining depth for complete understanding.

### **Module 6: Storage and RAID Systems**

#### **Classification of Physical Storage Media**
- **Key Factors for Classification**:
  1. **Speed**: Access speed varies across media (e.g., RAM is faster than SSD).
  2. **Cost**: Higher speed usually comes at a higher cost.
  3. **Reliability**: Risk of data loss due to crashes or physical damage.

- **Categories**:
  - **Volatile Storage**:
    - Loses data when powered off.
    - Example: Cache, RAM.
  - **Non-volatile Storage**:
    - Data persists without power.
    - Includes secondary (HDD, SSD) and tertiary storage (magnetic tapes, optical disks).

---

#### **Storage Hierarchy**
1. **Primary Storage**:
   - Fastest, volatile.
   - Examples: Cache, main memory.

2. **Secondary Storage**:
   - Non-volatile, moderate access speed.
   - Examples: SSDs, HDDs.

3. **Tertiary Storage**:
   - Slowest, non-volatile, for backups or archives.
   - Examples: Magnetic tapes, optical disks.

#### **Magnetic Disk Mechanism**
1. **Structure**:
   - **Platters**: Circular disks where data is magnetically stored.
   - **Read/Write Head**: Reads/writes data.
   - **Tracks & Sectors**:
     - **Tracks**: Concentric circles on the platter.
     - **Sectors**: Small divisions within tracks (smallest readable/writable unit, typically 512 bytes).

2. **Head-Disk Assembly**:
   - Multiple platters on a spindle.
   - Heads are mounted on a common arm and move together.

3. **Cylinder**:
   - Collection of tracks aligned vertically across platters.

---

#### **Disk Performance Terms**
1. **Seek Time**: Time for the head to move to the correct track.
2. **Rotational Latency**: Time for the platter to spin to the desired sector.
3. **Access Time**: Total time to read/write data.
   - **Formula**: Access Time = Seek Time + Rotational Latency.

---

#### **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**
- Combines multiple drives for improved speed, reliability, or both.

1. **RAID 0 (Striping)**:
   - Splits data across drives.
   - High speed, no redundancy (data loss if one drive fails).

2. **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**:
   - Duplicates data across drives.
   - High redundancy, lower storage efficiency.

3. **RAID 5**:
   - Stripes data with distributed parity.
   - Can tolerate one disk failure.
   - Balances speed and fault tolerance.

4. **RAID 6**:
   - Like RAID 5 but adds dual parity.
   - Can handle two drive failures.

5. **RAID 10**:
   - Combines RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping).
   - High speed and redundancy, but expensive.

---

#### **Exercises in Module 6**
- **Storage Capacity Calculation**:
  - Example: Disk with 8 surfaces, 5000 tracks per surface, 64 sectors per track, and 1024 bytes/sector.
  - **Capacity** = \( 8 \times 5000 \times 64 \times 1024 = 2500 \, \text{MB} \).

- **Transfer Rate**:
  - Example: Rotational speed = 500 rps, 102,400 bytes per revolution.
  - **Transfer Rate** = \( 102,400 \times 500 = 51.2 \, \text{MB/s} \).

### **Module 7: High-Performance Processors**

#### **Flynn’s Taxonomy**
1. **SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)**:
   - Executes one instruction on one data at a time.
   - Example: Traditional single-core processors.

2. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**:
   - One instruction processes multiple data streams in parallel.
   - Example: GPUs, vector processors.

3. **MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)**:
   - Multiple instructions operate on the same data stream.
   - Example: Fault-tolerant systems.

4. **MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)**:
   - Different processors execute different instructions on different data.
   - Example: Multi-core CPUs, distributed computing clusters.

---

#### **Pipelining**
1. **Concept**:
   - Instructions are divided into stages (fetch, decode, execute, etc.).
   - Each stage works on different instructions simultaneously.

2. **Hazards**:
   - **Structural Hazards**: Resource conflicts (e.g., single ALU shared by multiple instructions).
   - **Data Hazards**:
     - RAW (Read After Write): Instruction depends on data not yet written.
     - WAR (Write After Read): Instruction writes data before another reads it.
     - WAW (Write After Write): Two instructions write to the same location out of order.
   - **Control Hazards**: Caused by branch instructions.

3. **Solutions**:
   - **Forwarding**: Directly passes data between pipeline stages.
   - **Stalling**: Halts pipeline until dependencies are resolved.
   - **Branch Prediction**:
     - Predicts branch direction to avoid stalls.
     - Techniques: Static (fixed) or Dynamic (based on history).

---

#### **Superscalar Architecture**
1. **Features**:
   - Multiple pipelines allow parallel instruction execution.
   - Dynamic scheduling and out-of-order execution improve performance.

2. **Comparison**:
   - **Superscalar**: Executes multiple instructions per cycle using parallelism.
   - **Super-Pipelined**: Increases pipeline depth for higher clock speeds but processes one instruction per cycle.

3. **Techniques**:
   - **Instruction Fetch & Decode**: Multiple instructions fetched and decoded in parallel.
   - **Dynamic Scheduling**:
     - **Tomasulo’s Algorithm**: Resolves hazards by renaming registers.
   - **Speculative Execution**: Executes instructions before confirming branch decisions.

---

#### **Performance Metrics**
1. **Speedup**:
   - How much faster a task runs with multiple processors.
   - **Amdahl’s Law**: Speedup is limited by the sequential part of a program.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Measures how well additional processors are utilized.

---

#### **Exercises in Module 7**
- **CPI Calculation**:
  - Example: A superscalar processor executes 1000 instructions, with 100 cycles of data hazards, 50 cycles of branch mispredictions, and 30 cycles of cache misses.
  - **CPI** = \( \frac{\text{Total Cycles}}{\text{Total Instructions}} = \frac{430}{1000} = 0.43 \).

- **Speedup**:
  - Example: Scalar processor takes 300 cycles; superscalar takes 100 cycles.
  - **Speedup** = \( \frac{\text{Scalar Time}}{\text{Superscalar Time}} = \frac{300}{100} = 3 \).
