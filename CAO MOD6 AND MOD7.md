### **Module 6: Storage and RAID Systems**

#### **Classification of Physical Storage Media**
- **Key Factors for Classification**:
  1. **Speed**: Access speed varies across media (e.g., RAM is faster than SSD).
  2. **Cost**: Higher speed usually comes at a higher cost.
  3. **Reliability**: Risk of data loss due to crashes or physical damage.

- **Categories**:
  - **Volatile Storage**:
    - Loses data when powered off.
    - Example: Cache, RAM.
  - **Non-volatile Storage**:
    - Data persists without power.
    - Includes secondary (HDD, SSD) and tertiary storage (magnetic tapes, optical disks).

---

#### **Storage Hierarchy**
1. **Primary Storage**:
   - Fastest, volatile.
   - Examples: Cache, main memory.

2. **Secondary Storage**:
   - Non-volatile, moderate access speed.
   - Examples: SSDs, HDDs.

3. **Tertiary Storage**:
   - Slowest, non-volatile, for backups or archives.
   - Examples: Magnetic tapes, optical disks.

#### **Magnetic Disk Mechanism**
1. **Structure**:
   - **Platters**: Circular disks where data is magnetically stored.
   - **Read/Write Head**: Reads/writes data.
   - **Tracks & Sectors**:
     - **Tracks**: Concentric circles on the platter.
     - **Sectors**: Small divisions within tracks (smallest readable/writable unit, typically 512 bytes).

2. **Head-Disk Assembly**:
   - Multiple platters on a spindle.
   - Heads are mounted on a common arm and move together.

3. **Cylinder**:
   - Collection of tracks aligned vertically across platters.

---

#### **Disk Performance Terms**
1. **Seek Time**: Time for the head to move to the correct track.
2. **Rotational Latency**: Time for the platter to spin to the desired sector.
3. **Access Time**: Total time to read/write data.
   - **Formula**: Access Time = Seek Time + Rotational Latency.

### **What is an SSD?**  
A **Solid-State Drive (SSD)** is a type of non-volatile storage device that stores data on flash memory. Unlike traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), SSDs have no moving parts, making them faster, more durable, and energy-efficient.

---

### **Structure of an SSD**  
An SSD is composed of several key components:

1. **Flash Memory**  
   - The main storage area where data is stored. Most SSDs use NAND flash memory, which is non-volatile and retains data even without power.

2. **Controller (Flash Controller)**  
   - The brain of the SSD, responsible for managing data storage, retrieval, and wear leveling.

3. **Cache**  
   - A small amount of DRAM or SRAM memory for temporary storage to speed up operations.

4. **Interface**  
   - Connects the SSD to the computer (e.g., SATA, NVMe, PCIe).

5. **Firmware**  
   - Software embedded in the controller that manages the SSD's operations and features.

---

### **Flash Controller (SSD Controller)**  
The controller is a critical component of an SSD that manages how data is written, read, and erased. Its key responsibilities include:

1. **Wear Leveling**  
   - Ensures even distribution of write operations to prolong the life of the NAND flash.

2. **Error Correction**  
   - Detects and corrects errors in data.

3. **Garbage Collection**  
   - Manages unused blocks of data to improve efficiency.

4. **TRIM Support**  
   - Optimizes performance by allowing the operating system to inform the SSD which blocks of data are no longer in use.

5. **Encryption**  
   - Provides data security through hardware-based encryption.

6. **Bad Block Management**  
   - Identifies and manages defective blocks of memory.

---

### **Advantages of SSDs**  
1. **High Speed**  
   - Faster boot times, data access, and application loading compared to HDDs.

2. **Durability**  
   - Resistant to physical shocks and vibrations due to no moving parts.

3. **Energy Efficiency**  
   - Consumes less power, ideal for laptops and portable devices.

4. **Quiet Operation**  
   - No noise as there are no spinning disks or moving read/write heads.

   - Lightweight and available in various form factors like M.2 and U.2.

---

### **Disadvantages of SSDs**  
1. **Higher Cost**  
   - More expensive per gigabyte compared to HDDs.

2. **Limited Lifespan**  
   - Finite number of write cycles for NAND flash memory, though modern SSDs have improved endurance.

3. **Data Recovery Challenges**  
   - Data recovery from failed SSDs is often more complex than from HDDs.

4. **Capacity Constraints**  
   - High-capacity SSDs are available but are much more costly than equivalent HDDs.

---

### **Features of SSDs**  
1. **Non-Volatile Storage**  
   - Retains data even when power is off.

2. **High Reliability**  
   - Resistant to mechanical failures.

3. **Varied Interfaces**  
   - Supports SATA, NVMe, and PCIe for different performance needs.

4. **Low Latency**  
   - Delivers quicker response times compared to HDDs.

5. **Support for TRIM**  
   - Improves performance and longevity.

6. **Encryption**  
   - Provides hardware-level security for sensitive data.

---

### **Summary**  
SSDs are ideal for performance-critical applications due to their speed, durability, and efficiency. However, their higher cost and capacity limitations compared to HDDs make them less suitable for bulk storage. With advancements in technology, SSDs are becoming increasingly popular across consumer, enterprise, and industrial applications.

#### **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**
- Combines multiple drives for improved speed, reliability, or both.

1. **RAID 0 (Striping)**:
   - Splits data across drives.
   - High speed, no redundancy (data loss if one drive fails).

2. **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**:
   - Duplicates data across drives.
   - High redundancy, lower storage efficiency.

3. **RAID 5**:
   - Stripes data with distributed parity.
   - Can tolerate one disk failure.
   - Balances speed and fault tolerance.

4. **RAID 6**:
   - Like RAID 5 but adds dual parity.
   - Can handle two drive failures.

5. **RAID 10**:
   - Combines RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping).
   - High speed and redundancy, but expensive.

#### **Exercises in Module 6**
- **Storage Capacity Calculation**:
  - Example: Disk with 8 surfaces, 5000 tracks per surface, 64 sectors per track, and 1024 bytes/sector.
  - **Capacity** = 8 × 5000 × 64 × 1024 = 2,500MB

- **Transfer Rate**:
  - Example: Rotational speed = 500 rps, 102,400 bytes per revolution.
  - **Transfer Rate** = 102,400 × 500 = 51.2 MB/s

### **Module 7: High-Performance Processors**

#### **Flynn’s Taxonomy**
1. **SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)**:
   - Executes one instruction on one data at a time.
   - Example: Traditional single-core processors.

2. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**:
   - One instruction processes multiple data streams in parallel.
   - Example: GPUs, vector processors.

3. **MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)**:
   - Multiple instructions operate on the same data stream.
   - Example: Fault-tolerant systems.

4. **MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)**:
   - Different processors execute different instructions on different data.
   - Example: Multi-core CPUs, distributed computing clusters.

---

#### **Pipelining**
1. **Concept**:
   - Instructions are divided into stages (fetch, decode, execute, etc.).
   - Each stage works on different instructions simultaneously.

2. **Hazards**:
   - **Structural Hazards**: Resource conflicts (e.g., single ALU shared by multiple instructions).
   - **Data Hazards**:
     - RAW (Read After Write): Instruction depends on data not yet written.
     - WAR (Write After Read): Instruction writes data before another reads it.
     - WAW (Write After Write): Two instructions write to the same location out of order.
   - **Control Hazards**: Caused by branch instructions.

3. **Solutions**:
   - **Forwarding**: Directly passes data between pipeline stages.
   - **Stalling**: Halts pipeline until dependencies are resolved.
   - **Branch Prediction**:
     - Predicts branch direction to avoid stalls.
     - Techniques: Static (fixed) or Dynamic (based on history).

   - Dynamic scheduling and out-of-order execution improve performance.

2. **Comparison**:
   - **Superscalar**: Executes multiple instructions per cycle using parallelism.
   - **Super-Pipelined**: Increases pipeline depth for higher clock speeds but processes one instruction per cycle.

3. **Techniques**:
   - **Instruction Fetch & Decode**: Multiple instructions fetched and decoded in parallel.
   - **Dynamic Scheduling**:
     - **Tomasulo’s Algorithm**: Resolves hazards by renaming registers.
   - **Speculative Execution**: Executes instructions before confirming branch decisions.

---

#### **Performance Metrics**
1. **Speedup**:
   - How much faster a task runs with multiple processors.
   - **Amdahl’s Law**: Speedup is limited by the sequential part of a program.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Measures how well additional processors are utilized.

---

#### **Exercises in Module 7**
- **CPI Calculation**:
  - Example: A superscalar processor executes 1000 instructions, with 100 cycles of data hazards, 50 cycles of branch mispredictions, and 30 cycles of cache misses.
  - **CPI** = Total Cycles / Total Instructions = 430 / 1000 = 0.43

- **Speedup**:
  - Example: Scalar processor takes 300 cycles; superscalar takes 100 cycles.
  - **Speedup** = (Scalar Time) / (Superscalar Time) = 300 / 100 = 3
